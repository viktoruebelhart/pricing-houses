# pricing-houses

We will analyze a project that aimed to establish the selling price of a house. And not only that, we needed to understand which factors most influenced the definition of this price. We wanted to understand the effect of these explanatory variables to then determine a sales price for the houses.

We even use a methodology within Data Science, which is linear regression, to achieve this business objective.

Dataset and exploratory analysis of which factors could best explain the sales price. We even adjusted a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable, which was the area of ​​the first floor, thus explaining this price.

We analyze this model, price houses and also carry out other common procedures within Machine Learning, such as training and testing, to have a model capable of generalizing. In other words, pricing houses that were not there within our model training.

We also realized that this model did not fully explain the price of houses through R², which was around 37%. Then, we added other factors to increase the explainability of this model. We even trained three models and compared them manually, choosing one closest to what we needed to establish the sales price of the houses.

With the chosen model, we priced a house that was there with its characteristics and also several other houses at once, to deliver to a possible brokerage.

And, in the end, we analyzed our pricing tool, model 3. We then understood the residuals, the issue of homoscedasticity, and we understood the difference and limitations between the observed prices and those priced with our model.
